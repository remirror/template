# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), and provides the blog and documentation for the remirror project.

The documentation is compiled from the `.md` and `.mdx` files in the the `/docs` folder

### Installation

From the root directory of the project run the following.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Local Development

```bash
pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
